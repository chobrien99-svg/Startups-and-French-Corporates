# France Has the Startups. So Why Won't Anyone Buy From Them?

**The French tech ecosystem is brimming with talent, ideas, and ambition. But a stubborn procurement gap between startups and the corporates and government agencies that should be their biggest customers threatens to undermine the whole project.**

---

France likes to think of itself as a startup nation. And in many ways, it is. The country has built one of Europe's most vibrant innovation ecosystems, producing heavyweights like Mistral AI in artificial intelligence, Pigment in finance, and Exotec in industrial robotics. Fundraising across Europe surged 18% in 2025, hitting 55 billion euros, with AI alone capturing a quarter of all global investment. A full 81% of European AI startup founders choose to stay on the continent. The talent is here. The ideas are here. The ambition is here.

What's missing? Customers.

That's the blunt takeaway from a flurry of reports and events that landed in early February 2026, all circling the same uncomfortable truth: French and European startups are struggling to sell to the very institutions — large corporations and government agencies — that should be their most natural buyers. And without those contracts, even the most brilliant startups risk remaining forever small, forever fragile, or worse, packing their bags for the United States.

The numbers tell a stark story. According to the 2025 Observatory of Relations Between Startups and Major Accounts, published by France's Mediator of Enterprises Pierre Pelouzet and presented to Anne Le Hénanff, the Minister for AI and Digital, large French corporations devote on average just under 2% of their purchasing budgets to startups. Some of the most engaged groups spend upward of 200 million euros a year on startup solutions, but others scrape by at a mere 2 million. The gap between leaders and laggards is enormous — and it reveals just how much untapped potential sits on the table.

On the public side, there has been genuine progress. Government procurement from startups jumped 33.4% in 2023, crossing the 2.3-billion-euro mark. The "Je Choisis la French Tech" program, launched in 2023, has helped: ministries, spurred partly by the push around the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, ramped up purchases sharply. Contracts under 100,000 euros — which benefit from lighter bureaucratic requirements — accounted for a remarkable 91% of all public deals with startups. But even with that surge, public procurement of innovation in Europe averages just 9% of total spending. In the United States, it's 20%. In South Korea, 25%. Europe, for all its talk, is still punching well below its weight.

And then there are the structural headaches that refuse to go away. The Observatory's surveys found that it takes startups an average of 4.5 months just to make initial contact with a large buyer, and a grueling 8 months to land an actual contract. Decision-making cycles that startups experience as agonizingly slow are considered perfectly normal by the corporates on the other side of the table. Nearly half of all startups have zero commercial relationship with the public sector. And only 42% of large accounts had signed a contract with a startup in the previous 12 months. The processes are opaque, the right contacts are hard to identify, and formal tenders are frequently ill-suited to the realities of young companies. As Pelouzet put it diplomatically: "These are not insurmountable barriers. We have a lot of room for maneuver."

The JFD's European AI Barometer 2026, released by the innovation accelerator's founder Delphine Remy-Boutang and produced with EY Fabernovel, framed the challenge in even starker geopolitical terms. Europe holds just 5% of global computing power. Its startups receive seven times less investment than their American counterparts. And the continent has produced a staggering 13,000 legislative acts over five years compared to 3,500 in the US — a regulatory thicket so dense that 23% of European AI startups are actively considering leaving for America. "The subject is no longer just who codes the AI," Remy-Boutang declared at a ceremony at Bercy, "but who controls the AI we use."

Her proposed solution is characteristically ambitious: a "demand shock." The JFD's coalition of 30 major European business leaders — including Carrefour, LVMH, La Poste, Veolia, L'Oréal, and Mastercard — has set a target of reaching 9% of private innovative purchases from European startups within two years, aligning the private sector with the public procurement benchmark. The goal is to build what Remy-Boutang calls a European "Mittelstand" of innovation — a fabric of midsized, profitable, resilient tech companies capable of competing globally, modeled on the backbone of Germany's industrial economy. "The best financing for a company is its customer," she said. "Entrepreneurs don't want support speeches. They want contracts."

That refrain echoed loudly at France Digitale's AI Day at Station F, where panelists including Anne Bouverot, co-chair of France's AI and Digital Council, and Business France's Pascal Cagni were, by all accounts, bracingly direct. The big corporates, they said, remain the weak link. While some progress has been made in digital transformation, it remains "woefully inadequate." AI, they argued, represents a kind of last chance: if Europe's biggest companies don't seize this moment to reinvent themselves and integrate startup innovation into their operations at scale, the continent risks falling permanently behind.

There are encouraging signs amid the frustration. The "Je Choisis la French Tech" program now counts more than 700 member companies. Fourteen major groups, recently joined by Renault and La Poste, have collectively pledged one billion euros toward French startups and scale-ups by 2027. Startups themselves are professionalizing: 65% already collaborate with large groups, up sharply from 48% in the previous survey, and nearly half derive more than 20% of their revenue from major accounts.

But the deeper problem is cultural as much as structural. France, and Europe more broadly, has spent two decades getting good at *creating* startups. The incubators are world-class. The public investment arms like Bpifrance are effective. The engineering talent is exceptional. What remains stubbornly underdeveloped is the ecosystem's ability to turn those startups into durable, scaled businesses — and that requires the one thing no government program can manufacture on its own: real customers writing real checks.

"This barometer is not a simple status report," Pelouzet wrote. "It is a call to action. Behind the numbers, there is a clear political ambition: to significantly increase public and private procurement from startups in the very near future."

The startups are ready. The question is whether France's boardrooms and ministries are, too.
